# CSE305_EnsembleChurnProject
Customer Churn Prediction Analysis Using Ensemble Techniques in Machine Learning
## Try these
1. Memory compression by converting all float values from 64bits to 16bits
2. Drop column which are unique to each row like name, userid, etc
3. Create the train test split before we start performing Data preprocessing and visuvalizations
4. Find out the perfect classification metric (usually accuracy won't be the best option, plot churn vs not churned)
5. Plot all the continuous variables and start drawing conclusions after each and every single plot 
6. Check for correlation among continous variables and remove them to avoid multi-collinearity problem
7. Plot boxplots to find out outliers. Draw inferences from those outliers.
8. Plot all the categorical variables and see how it affects the churn rate.
9. Start off data preprocessing by applying proper feature selection techniques
10. Perform label, ordinal and one hot encodings as appropriate
11. Scale values
12. Understand how to deal with skewed target values (less churn and more not churned)
